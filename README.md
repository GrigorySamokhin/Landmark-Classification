#  Landmark Image Classification with K Nearest Neighbours

A program uses the content of an image, to search for the most similar images in a database. In order to find the closest match, the system must use an algorithm to efficiently find key "descriptors" for an image that can be used to compare to the descriptors of images in the database.

##   Project Objectives
>  Extracted keypoint detectors with ResNet pre-trained model from dataset
>  Accepted a query image
>  Using K Nearest Neighbours Classification

### Data
For this project i choose [Paris6k](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/parisbuildings/) dataset, but i cropped it to 50 images per class for KNN, photos stored in **paris** directory. 
Testing data is set of photos from google stored in **paris_test** directory. But you can generate own testing directory with following command (default size of test_dataset: 10%):

    python3 main.py --mode create_test_dataset --dataset $PATH
    Dataset structure: dataset/	class_1/
					class_2/
					...
					class_n/

### Model
In order to extract features from each image in the dataset, I use pre-trained ResNet like feature extractor, taking the activation’s available before the last fully connected layer of the network. These activation’s will be acting as the feature vector. The computed vectors from dataset are stored in metadata/ directory in .cpickle format. The minus of this approach is that if we will find quite different photo of object it makes false prediction.

Another implementation feature detection: 
- Harris Corner Detector
- SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
- SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)
- FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test)
- BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features)
- ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)
- LBP (Local Binary Patterns)
- Use another pre-trained NN


### Prediction

Prediction based on KNN classification. The model calculate the distance (using L1 norm or L2 norm distances) between query image and every image in dataset and take k (DEPTH in code) images.
After computing we need to load query image and get predictions by following command:

    python3 main.py --mode predict --dataset paris --query paris_test/eiffel_tower/10-projets-de-voyage-a-PARIS.jpg
  Output:

    Mode type: predict.
    Distance type: L1.
    GPU available: False.
    Dataset directory: paris.
    Computed feature vectors of dataset: False.
    Computing...
    
    Predicted class for query image: eiffel_tower. 
If we have pre-computed vectors we will see:

    Mode type: predict.
    Distance type: L1.
    GPU available: False.
    Dataset directory: paris.
    Computed feature vectors of dataset: True.
    
    Predicted class for query image: eiffel_tower.

On CPU all vectors in dataset **paris** with 50 images in 5 classes will computed in 30 min, in GPU 20 second.

### Metrcis
**MAP (Mean Average Precision)**

    python3 --mode map --dataset paris
  Output

     Mode type: map.
    Distance type: L1.
    GPU available: False.
    Dataset directory: paris.
    Computed feature vectors of dataset: True.
    
    MAP based on first 3 vectors

    Class: eiffel_tower, MAP: 0.94
    Class: defense, MAP: 0.99
    Class: louvre, MAP: 0.93
    Class: invalides, MAP: 0.98
    MMAP:  0.968888888888889

  **Accuracy**

    python3 --mode accuracy --dataset paris --test_dataset paris_test
Output

    Mode type: accuracy.
    Distance type: L1.
    GPU available: False.
    Dataset directory: paris.
    Computed feature vectors of dataset: True.
        
    Class: defense, accuracy: 0.8.
    Class: eiffel_tower, accuracy: 1.0.
    Class: invalides, accuracy: 1.0.
